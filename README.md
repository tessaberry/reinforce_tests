Various Reinforcement Learning algorithms

#A2C
Advantage Actor Critic `A2C.py` is a state of the art RL algorithm
that involves two models (or two out puts of one model): a policy actor 
and a separate value model.  Advantage actor critic goes further 
and tries to distinguish between the inherent advantage of being in a state
from the value you get from taking the next action.

## Models
Classes for neural networks

#A2C models
These classes are set up specifically for A2C 
(they will have two outputs: an actor and a critic)
